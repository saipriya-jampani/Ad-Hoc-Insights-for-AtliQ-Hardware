# Ad-Hoc-Insights-for-AtliQ-Hardware

### Project Objective and Overview

## Objective:
The goal is to analyze specific ad-hoc data requests from the management team, providing valuable insights that can guide data-informed decision-making and strategic planning.

## Overview:
Atliq Hardwares, a leading computer hardware producer in India and internationally, seeks to enhance its data analytics capabilities. The management has identified a gap in quick access to actionable insights, prompting the need for junior data analysts. As an applicant, I will review a document containing 10 ad-hoc requests, develop SQL queries to extract relevant data, and present the findings in a clear and engaging format tailored to top-level management. This presentation will emphasize not only the technical analysis but also the storytelling aspect, ensuring the insights are easily understood and actionable.

## Task: 

1. Review Ad-Hoc Requests:
   - Analyze the provided PDF containing 10 specific data requests from the management to understand their needs and objectives.

2. SQL Query Development:
   - Create SQL queries to extract and manipulate data from the database based on the requests. The queries will be designed to address the specific insights requested, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

3. Presentation Preparation:
   The presentation will include:
     - Introduction to the ad-hoc requests and their significance.
     - Visualization of the findings with commentary on implications for the business.

This structured approach will not only demonstrate my technical skills but also showcase my ability to communicate complex information effectively to non-technical stakeholders, aligning with the needs of Atliq Hardwares’ management team.
